# Design Patterns – Overview

## What Are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are **well-defined solutions** to common software design problems.  
They represent the **practical implementation of design principles** that have been proven to work in real-world systems.

### Key Points
- Implement design principles in practice
- Provide reusable solutions to recurring design problems

---

## Why Do We Learn Design Patterns?
Design patterns help developers write **better, cleaner, and more maintainable code**.

### Benefits
- Provide a **shared vocabulary** among developers
- Save development time by using proven solutions
- Improve code readability and maintainability
- Reduce design complexity

---

## Types of Design Patterns
Design patterns are commonly categorized into three types:

1. **Creational Design Patterns**
2. **Structural Design Patterns**
3. **Behavioral Design Patterns**

---

## Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns focus on **object creation mechanisms**.

### Purpose
- Control object creation
- Reduce tight coupling between classes
- Improve flexibility and reuse

### Description
These patterns deal with **class instantiation** and object creation.  
They can be:
- Class-creation patterns
- Object-creational patterns

---

## Structural Design Patterns
Structural design patterns focus on **class structure and object composition**.

### Purpose
- Define relationships between classes
- Increase functionality without modifying existing class structure

### Description
These patterns help combine classes and objects to form larger, flexible structures while keeping the system easy to maintain.

---

## Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral design patterns focus on **how objects interact and communicate**.

### Purpose
- Define communication between objects
- Encapsulate behavior
- Improve flexibility in behavior changes

### Description
These patterns describe **how classes and objects interact** and how specific behaviors are implemented within a system.

---

## Summary
- Design patterns provide reusable, proven solutions
- They improve communication, flexibility, and maintainability
- Understanding design patterns is essential for writing scalable software
