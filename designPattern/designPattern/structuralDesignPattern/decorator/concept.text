1-When We Used Decorator Pattern?
The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, dynamically,
without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
This pattern is useful when you need to add responsibilities to objects at runtime and want to avoid
an explosion of subclasses to cover every possible combination of added behaviors.
